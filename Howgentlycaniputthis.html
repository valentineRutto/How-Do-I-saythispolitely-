	<b><em>Dont you just hate when we lie to one another.. in the name of caring..!!!</em></b><p>
	I walk into a room and find one of my friends with her face sunk deep into the pillow like a troll on his food,<br>
	obviously,I get concerned and ask for the reason as to why she is crying, as predictable as it looked I was hoping <br>
	for something reasonable,only for it to be guy trouble.... tssk!!.<p>
	Wearing a <em>"I care about it face"</em>, I listened keenly, then I hear a soft voice behind me saying,<em>"its okay,hes probably just<br>
	 thinking about what it he want thats why he was with the other girl,he will be back"</em>,I giggled so hard that i was almost laughing.<p>
	<b> Dont get me wrong</b>,i understand heartbreaks and I know just how much they can torture and burn the soul,heart and sometimes the self-esteem,<br>
	I also understand that its okay to cry and let out the anger of a broken heart
but <i>ooh c'mon girls</i>,If he is cheating;Hes cheating, If it aint you honey:it aint..So stop looking for excuses to stay there.<p>
Sometimes,you have to love yourself more than the second person, If you have no strenght to do so<br>
let your <i>ego</i> drive you, and besides you dont need a man to be alive..<br>
<h3 align="center"><b>Stop telling yourself this lies..!</b></h3>

5. "We can fix it." This is the most deceiving lie because it can lead to over-analyzing the broken pieces.<br>
Was it just a chip? Completely shattered? Or perhaps a clean break that just needs a little TLC? <br>But the truth is, it's still broken. If it wasn't broken to begin with, you wouldn't have to convince yourself it's fixable.<p>

4. "Things weren't as bad as I thought they were." He likes chocolate, you prefer vanilla. <br>You love listening to music and he can't name his favorite song. Your love language<br> is through physical touch, his is through acts of service. Yes, opposites can attract,<br>but that doesn't mean they provide the foundation for a lasting relationship. Know your <br>deal-breakers. Twenty years from now, do you really want to still be arguing over milkshake flavors <br>while he yells at you to turn the music off because the lyrics are too sad?<p>

3. "All relationships are work." They say in jobs, if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.<br>Now translate this to your relationship. Anything forced is <br>."work" because things we find enjoyable are "fun." Nothing in life should ever be forced.<br>Magic happens when things manifest themselves organically. This doesn't mean effort <br>won't be required to keep love alive, but if you have to imagine someone else <br>every time you go for a bedroom romp, it might be time update your Match.com profile.<p>

2. "I should've waited until after the holidays." There's always another birthday, <br>anniversary or Kwanza right around the corner. Before you know it, it's already next year's<br>Hanukkah and you want nothing more than to set your relationship on fire than the effing menorah. <br>Rip the Band-Aid. The quicker you allow fresh air into the wound, the quicker it can heal.<p>
1. "I'm going to end up alone." Staying with the wrong person because you're afraid you'll end up single <br>with sixteen cats in a knitting-club displays nothing but fear and lack <br>of self-love. We are never alone or lonely if we love the one we're with.<br> Start loving yourself and you'll realize all the quirks your ex despised about you are exactly what <br>make you perfect. So find a more realistic fear, like Rebecca Black's next single.<p><p>

<em><b>Remember you cant protect yourself from sadness without missing out on happines</b></em>
